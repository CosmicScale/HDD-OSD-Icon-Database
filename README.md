# HDD-OSD Icon Database
**Game Icon Count: 7,847 / 22,550**  
**VMC Icon Count: 5,093 / 11,016**  

This is a collection of PlayStation 2 icons created for use with HDD-OSD. When installing games using the [PSBBN Definitive English Patch](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch) game installer, icons are downloaded from this repository.

Most of the icons have been autogenerated by the game installer. Missing icons are reported and logged in `missing-icons.log` and `missing-vmc.log`.
