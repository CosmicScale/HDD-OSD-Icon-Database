# HDD-OSD Icon Database
**Game Icon Count: 8,615 / 22,550**  
**VMC Icon Count: 5,358 / 11,016**  

This is a collection of PlayStation 2 icons created for use with **HDD-OSD/Browser 2.0**. When installing games using the **[PSBBN Definitive Project](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch)** game installer, icons are downloaded from this repository.

Most of the icons have been autogenerated by the game installer. Missing icons are reported and logged in `missing-icons.log` and `missing-vmc.log`.

## How You Can Help  

### Submitting Missing Icons to the Database
Icons can only be automatically created if sufficient assets are available in the OPL Manager Art Database. The **[HDD-OSD Icon Generator](https://github.com/CosmicScale/HDD-OSD-Icon-Generator)** allows you to create your own HDD-OSD icons by manually supplying the required images.

You are encouraged to contribute all icons created with the icon generator to this database so they can be used by the community. To contribute your icons, **[open an issue](https://github.com/CosmicScale/HDD-OSD-Icon-Database/issues/new)** and attach the `.ZIP` file containing your icons.

### Contribute via Ko-Fi  
**[PSBBN Definitive Project](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch)** project uses **[webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)** to automatically contribute icons and report missing icons to this database. A free account only provides a temporary URL for seven days and 100 requests. As the project grows in popularity, we're exceeding the 100-request limit every days. A paid subscription costs $9/month or $90/year. Donations help fund this.

If you appreciate my work and want to support the ongoing development of the **[PSBBN Definitive Project](https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch)** and other PS2-related projects, **[you can donate to my Ko-Fi here](https://ko-fi.com/cosmicscale)**.
